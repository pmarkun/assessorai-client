# Design Principles

This project follows a minimalist and functional design focused on clarity and ease of use. The main guidelines are:

- **Simplicity first**: interfaces should be free of clutter, using whitespace to highlight important actions.
- **Consistent colors**: keep a light background and dark text. Use the purple `#A541FF` palette for highlights and interactive elements.
- **Responsive by default**: all pages must look good on mobile and desktop. Use Tailwind's responsive utilities and avoid fixed widths.
- **Accessible typography**: prefer large readable fonts and maintain contrast ratios that meet accessibility standards.
- **Reusable components**: forms and cards use rounded corners, subtle shadows and consistent spacing.
- **Smooth interactions**: transitions for menus and buttons should be subtle to keep the experience professional.

Following these principles helps maintain a coherent user experience as new features are developed.
